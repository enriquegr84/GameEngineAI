// Process class
// 
// Processes are ended by one of three methods: Success, Failure, or Aborted.
//		- Success means the process completed successfully.  If the process has a child, it will be attached to 
//		  the process mgr.
//		- Failure means the process started but failed in some way.  If the process has a child, it will be 
//		  aborted.
//		- Aborted processes are processes that are canceled while not submitted to the process mgr.  Depending 
//		  on the circumstances, they may or may not have gotten an OnInit() call.  For example, a process can 
//		  spawn another process and call AttachToParent() on itself.  If the new process fails, the child will
//		  get an Abort() call on it, even though its status is RUNNING.
